### Project Summary: Amazon Sales Analytics Dashboard

This Power BI dashboard provides a highly professional, real-time analytical platform for monitoring and evaluating Amazon's sales and product performance across key metrics and time periods.

**Objective:**
To deliver a single, centralized view of sales performance, product trends, and customer engagement, enabling stakeholders to quickly identify revenue drivers, understand seasonality, and make data-driven decisions regarding inventory and marketing strategies.

**Key Components and Metrics:**

1.  **Executive Overview (KPIs):** The dashboard provides an immediate snapshot of the business's health through four primary Key Performance Indicators:
    * **YTD Sales (\$2.2M)**
    * **QTD Sales (\$811.1K)**
    * **YTD Products Sold (28K)**
    * **YTD Reviews (19.4M)**

2.  **Sales Trends and Velocity:** The visualization features granular sales tracking through:
    * **Sales By Month:** A trend analysis that clearly reveals seasonality, with sales showing strong momentum and peaking in the latter part of the year (August through December).
    * **Sales By Week:** A detailed view of weekly sales volume, highlighting performance consistency and identifying potential weekly promotional spikes.

3.  **Product Performance Breakdown:** The analysis layers focus on specific product contributions:
    * **Sales By Product Category:** A comprehensive table view detailing Year-to-Date (YTD) and Quarter-to-Date (QTD) sales figures for various product categories (e.g., Mobile & Accessories, Camera, Men Clothes).
    * **Top 5 Products by YTD Sales:** A bar chart identifying the highest revenue-generating products (e.g., Nikon, Vince Co.), allowing for focused marketing efforts.
    * **Top 5 Product by YTD Reviews:** A bar chart highlighting products with the highest customer engagement (e.g., SanDisk), which can inform customer service and quality control initiatives.

**Functionality:**
The dashboard is fully interactive, featuring dropdown filters for **Product Category** and **Quarter**, allowing users to segment the data and perform deep-dive analysis into specific market areas and timeframes.
